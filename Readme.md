# Coding Programs by Numbers

These was a discussion in  Computability, complexity, and languages (written by Martin Davis),
introduced some instructions to reach the coding of program by numbers.

Now I've implemented the algorithm by Node.js Language to give it a number and get the coding.
for resolving running issues I connect the code with a telegram bot to see result and test code easily.
